    """
    This smoke test suite assumes that Nova has been configured to
    boot VM's with Quantum-managed networking, and attempts to
    verify network connectivity as follows:

     * For a freshly-booted VM with an IP address ("port") on a given network:

       - the Tempest host can ping the IP address.  This implies that
         the VM has been assigned the correct IP address and has
         connectivity to the Tempest host.

       #TODO(mnewby) - Need to implement the following:
       - the Tempest host can ssh into the VM via the IP address and
         successfully execute the following:

         - ping an external IP address, implying external connectivity.

         - ping an external hostname, implying that dns is correctly
           configured.

         - ping an internal IP address, implying connectivity to another
           VM on the same network.

     There are presumed to be two types of networks: tenant and
     public.  A tenant network may or may not be reachable from the
     Tempest host.  A public network is assumed to be reachable from
     the Tempest host, and it should be possible to associate a public
     ('floating') IP address with a tenant ('fixed') IP address to
     faciliate external connectivity to a potentially unroutable
     tenant IP address.

     This test suite can be configured to test network connectivity to
     a VM via a tenant network, a public network, or both.  If both
     networking types are to be evaluated, tests that need to be
     executed remotely on the VM (via ssh) will only be run against
     one of the networks (to minimize test execution time).

     Determine which types of networks to test as follows:

     * Configure tenant network checks (via the
       'tenant_networks_reachable' key) if the Tempest host should
       have direct connectivity to tenant networks.  This is likely to
       be the case if Tempest is running on the same host as a
       single-node devstack installation with IP namespaces disabled.

     * Configure checks for a public network if a public network has
       been configured prior to the test suite being run and if the
       Tempest host should have connectivity to that public network.
       Checking connectivity for a public network requires that a
       value be provided for 'public_network_id'.  A value can
       optionally be provided for 'public_router_id' if tenants will
       use a shared router to access a public network (as is likely to
       be the case when IP namespaces are not enabled).  If a value is
       not provided for 'public_router_id', a router will be created
       for each tenant and use the network identified by
       'public_network_id' as its gateway.
